                <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Kristina. I am currently on my career change journey aspiring to become a Full Stack
                    developer. I am
                    attending LaGuardia's TechHire Open Code Bootcamp in NYC.</p>
                <p>I originally come from Russia, but have been living in NYC since 2018.</p>

                <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
                <p>I was doing a lot of different things prior to embarquing on my journey to become a professional
                    developer. I
                    worked as a tour gouide, an English teacher, a journalist, an online events manager...You name it.
                </p>
                <p>I have always loved languages, however. And one day I realized that programming languages are
                    languages, too!
                </p>

            <article id="hobbies">
                <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
                <p>I am a yoga enthusiast. I strongly believe that if you can control your body, you can control
                    everything in
                    life. Yoga, and especially my inversions practice, is constantly challenging me and showing me that
                    everything is possible.</p>
                <p>I also love traveling and learning foreign languages. I speak Russian, Englishm Spanish, German and
                    Portugues, and something is telling me I'm not going to stop there. To me, languages are about
                    understanding, connection and bringing people together. </p>
