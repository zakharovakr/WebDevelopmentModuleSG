        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2> 
        <p>Hi, I'm Kristina. I am currently on my career change journey aspiring to become a Full Stack developer. I am attending LaGuardia's TechHire Open Code Bootcamp in NYC.</p> 
        <p>I originally come from Russia, but have been living in NYC since 2018.</p> 

        <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2> 
        <p>I was doing a lot of different things prior to embarquing on my journey to become a professional developer. I worked as a tour gouide, an English teacher, a journalist, an online events manager...You name it.</p> 
        <p>I have always loved languages, however. And one day I realized that programming languages are languages, too!</p>

        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2> 
        <p>I am a yoga enthusiast. I strongly believe that if you can control your body, you can control everything in life. Yoga, and especially my inversions practice, is constantly challenging me and showing me that everything is possible.</p> 
        <p>I also love traveling and learning foreign languages. I speak Russian, Englishm Spanish, German and Portugues, and something is telling me I'm not going to stop there. To me, languages are about understanding, connection and bringing people together. </p>
